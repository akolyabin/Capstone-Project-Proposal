Bike Rental Project Proposal

June 9, 2018

The purpose of this study is to find out how much bike rentals differ based on the timing of the rental. Specifically changes in number of customers will be observed based on the type of day (weekday, weekend, holiday) as well as the time of the year (month and season).

The client for whom this study would be of interest is the bike renting company that produced the data, Capital Bike Share, as well as any other bike renting company that may be interested in the trends of their sales. Based on the analysis produced, the client would be able to know how much they ought to expect either increases or decreases in their sales based on the type of day as well as the time of year. Having this knowledge would help companies better percieve if any changes in their sales are simply due to the trend of the timing or another problem they should be concerned about.

The data used for this study will be a data set produced by Capital Bikeshare of bike rentals that occured in the year 2011. This contains the number of rentals for each day along with the information of whether the day was a weekday, weekend day, or holiday.

The approach to making the findings discussed starts with dividing the data properly into week days, weekend days, and holidays and taking the average number of rentals for each category. This grouping would also be done for each of the 12 months as well as for each of the 4 seasons of the year. Ratios would then be presented as percentages to indicate the popularity of rentals based on each category of day, month, and season.

The way this study will be presented is with a PowerPoint slideshow that will have all the necessary charts with summarized points of how those charts were put together and what they indicate. The charts likely to be presented are bar graphs depicting sale averages based on days, months, and seasons. There will also be a paper presented containing the R code compiled in wrangling the data and ouputting all the necessary charts along with a written summary of the findings.
